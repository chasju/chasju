### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Issa me, Mario  ![supermariowalkright](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91468816/172347690-be2cbfb4-0b98-44a4-8764-bc9d91138866.gif)

Jk. I'm Charlotte.

I'm a front end student who just got her first job as a web developer! Hurrah:)
The last two years of studying this field has done nothing but get me even more excited about the path that I am on, and I aspire to become both a front end as well as back end developer.

## ðŸ”­ 
My projects are currently a mix of html, css, vanilla javascript, reactjs and most of them are built using bootstrap.
