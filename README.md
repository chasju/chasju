### Hi there 👋 Issa me, Mario  ![supermariowalkright](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91468816/172347690-be2cbfb4-0b98-44a4-8764-bc9d91138866.gif)

Jk. I'm Charlotte.

I'm a front end student, currently trying to learn the ins and outs of everything related to the subject. I know, there's sooo much to learn, but that's what makes it exciting. 

## 🔭 
I’m currently working on my portfolio. I'm one of those creators (**is there really any other type of creator?**) that never ever is fully happy with their design, which makes publishing it very hard. However, if there is one thing I've learned from being alive 30+ years, it's that doing nothing gets you nowhere. So I'll just post and you'll critic. That's a good idea, right?

## 🪐 
When I'm not learning code I make some tiktoks, I like fashion, I own a telescope and I like to stay updated on social media. I've tried most of it, and find the marketing aspect of it very interesting.
